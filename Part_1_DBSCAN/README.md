# Part 1: DBSCAN

The first part of the project, involving the clustering of [textual data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cclark/product-item-data) with Sci-Kit Learn's DBSCAN. \
Contains two separate files offering a overviews of the pre-processing and research phases of said first part. \
It also contains the project folder for a simple script making recommendations based on my best clusterings.
