As part of the project, it was requested that students write a function making product recommendations based on a DBSCAN clustering.\
I decided to nest that function in a standalone mini-project using my best clusterings from Part 1 of the North Face project, as the other files in the deliverable were already quite long.

Set up the environment for the script by running `pip install -r requirements.txt` in the terminal from this folder, and then "make_data_files.py".
