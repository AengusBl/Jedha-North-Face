       "Guidewater waders - king - We built our Guidewater Waders to be the toughest, most puncture-resistant waterproof/breathable wader on the planet. Of course, we couldn't just stop there. Nope. They also had to be extremely lightweight while offering a groundbreaking level of comfort and convenience. In other words, the ultimate wader. We started by strategically placing varying weights of our proprietary waterproof/breathable polyester microfiber fabric package with H2No Hydrostorm barrier according to specific breathablility or toughness needs. The result? Max durability and flexibility without resorting to excessive heavy, sweat-trapping multiple layers. Our revolutionary merino wool grid-lined neoprene booties increase warmth to double that of normal nylon faced neoprene as it wicks perspiration creating guilt-inducing levels of foot comfort. The most advanced version of our innovative internal suspension system allows easy conversion to waist height and - this is critical - quick relief without having to remove your jacket or fight sticky zippers. More features: sculpted upper for reduced drag in heavy currents, anatomically designed left and right legs and booties, built in fabric gravel guards with abrasion-resistant scuff zones and high-filtration mesh drain strip.

There's also chilly air in any season, and that's where our Down Sweater comes in. It delivers minimal weight, superb compressibility and high-loft warmth. The ripstop shell (1.4-oz 22-denier) with a DWR (durable water repellent) finish does more than look sharp: It's tear-resistant and windproof and made from 100% all-recycled polyester.
